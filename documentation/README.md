# Maternal and Child Health County Analytics Dashboard (Kenya)

# Overview
This project is an interactive healthcare analytics dashboard designed to analyse county-level maternal and child health (MCH)indicators in Kenya.
It demostrates how healthcare data can be transformed to support planning, monitering, and decision-making.

# Problem being solved
Maternal and neonate health outcomes vary wildly across kenyan counties.
Raw data alone does not easily reveal:
Geographical disparities
High risk regions
Priority areas for intervention

# What this Project provides 
County level MCH Indicators
Georaphic heatmaps for comparison
Kpi summaries for decision support
A reusable Analytics workflow

# Key use Cases 
Public health monnitering 
County-level planning 
Healthcare Analytics interviews
Freelance Dashboard development

# Tools Used
Python(Pandas, Numpy)
Jupyter notebook
Power BI
Synthetic Healthcare data (privacy-safe)
